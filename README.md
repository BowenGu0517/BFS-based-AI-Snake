# BFS-based-AI-Snake
This is a tiny game prgrammed by C++. External library is ege graphic lib. Core knowledge is BFS algorithm. Current version is 1.0. There is still problem in the game. The snake will always go straight once the snake head is surrounded, cuz there is no path to find the vertex and edges to the destination.
